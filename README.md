# VehicleControls_stm32_HAL

During playing with bluetooth module i decided to refresh toy car from 20 years ago. It is my first project that i programmed and built.
It took me for sure too much time so i am writing this readme to close this chapter and move forward.

I programmed it using HAL library by STM32.

Modules that i used :
- STM32F103C6T6 blue pill clone
- JDY-09/JDY-31 bluetooth module for recieving data
- Okystar SG-90 micro-servo for direction control
- L298N motor controller for speed control 
- Motor that was already in a car
Other stuff that i used:
- 4x 1.5V Battery
- 3x LED
- LD1117AV33

I built controller that you can find here :
